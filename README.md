#### Collecting Analytics
A key part of any SEO audit is going through and gathering all of the data and analytics out there regarding your website content (traffic, keywords, referral traffic for each landing page, etc.)

#### Targeted Keywords
You always want to go through and analyze the keywords you’re targeting and using most frequently in your website content — to identify any changes in their performance, as well as for relative value to your business compared to your competition. You should also conduct research on overall keyword performance trends so you are always on top of the latest terms that may be worth pursuing in the immediate future.

#### Domain Issues
Make sure that there are no unsanctioned domains and/or subdomains out there that are linked to your company.

#### Check sitemaps
Make sure xml sitemaps are up to date

#### Linking Concerns
Obviously, it’s important to make sure you don’t have any broken links on your website. As part of your audit, you should routinely go through and spot check internal links to make sure everything is still working — especially on pages where your older content resides. It’s also important to have at least 1 or 2 internal links within all of your content. This is good practice for creating a quality user experience, as well as for SEO.
You also want to use an SEO tool (discussed in the next section) to help you identify links from outside sources that are pointing back toward your site. If external sites have poor or broken links that point back to your site, it can significantly impact your SEO.

#### Load Times
You always want to make sure that your pages load quickly and completely so you don’t turn your visitors away.

## Owned, Paind and Earned
Owned = Your content published by you on your site
Paid = PPC advertising, etc
Earned = likes, re-tweets, shares, mentions, etc. viral, raise credibility

## Semantic Search
#### What is semantic search?
How search engines discern context and user intent to return more  definitive answers, rather than the hierarchical list of guesses Google presented previously. Simply, semantic search helps Google present better results for any given search.
#### User intent
When search engines take user intent into account, that means two people searching for the exact same term could have completely different results. Results could be impacted by user location, search history, social media network, and “likes,” as well as many other factors, depending on the search engine’s particular algorithm.
#### Context
In addition to the context of user intent, search engines are striving to incorporate the context of the content itself into search results. That means engines are moving even further away from simple keyword-driven search and into a more holistic view of content creation — such as using meta-data such as rich snippets, incorporating synonyms into search, and taking into account what other information appears on an entire site or page
#### Better results
“Better” results means more useful and relevant results. Search engines are hoping to anticipate user needs and provide answers, not just results. For example, when I searched for “election” one day after the midterms, Google displayed a large map that showed the breakdown of victories by party, and then news results. The map was followed by recent news. I got an overview of what happened in the midterms without even needing to click away from the search page. My guess is, after some time has passed, perhaps a definition of the word “election” would show up first.

## Choose the right keyword
Even though search is becoming more context-driven, choosing the right keywords and using them in an optimized way is still important.

## Optimize your content

Once you’ve identified your target keywords, you have to be sure that your content is optimized for them.
