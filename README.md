## Semantic Search
#### What is semantic search?
How search engines discern context and user intent to return more  definitive answers, rather than the hierarchical list of guesses Google presented previously. Simply, semantic search helps Google present better results for any given search.
#### User intent
When search engines take user intent into account, that means two people searching for the exact same term could have completely different results. Results could be impacted by user location, search history, social media network, and “likes,” as well as many other factors, depending on the search engine’s particular algorithm.
#### Context
In addition to the context of user intent, search engines are striving to incorporate the context of the content itself into search results. That means engines are moving even further away from simple keyword-driven search and into a more holistic view of content creation — such as using meta-data such as rich snippets, incorporating synonyms into search, and taking into account what other information appears on an entire site or page
#### Better results
“Better” results means more useful and relevant results. Search engines are hoping to anticipate user needs and provide answers, not just results. For example, when I searched for “election” one day after the midterms, Google displayed a large map that showed the breakdown of victories by party, and then news results. The map was followed by recent news. I got an overview of what happened in the midterms without even needing to click away from the search page. My guess is, after some time has passed, perhaps a definition of the word “election” would show up first.

## Choose the right keyword
Even though search is becoming more context-driven, choosing the right keywords and using them in an optimized way is still important.

## Optimize your content

Once you’ve identified your target keywords, you have to be sure that your content is optimized for them.
